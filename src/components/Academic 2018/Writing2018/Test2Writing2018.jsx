                    The bar chart illustrates the proportion of households
                    owning and renting accommodation in England and Wales over a
                    period from 1918 to 2011. <br /> <br /> In 1918, the
                    majority of households were in rented accommodation, with
                    the figure standing at around 77%, while only about 23% of
                    households owned their accommodation. Over the next few
                    decades, the percentage of rented households gradually
                    declined. By 1971, the proportion of rented and owned
                    households was roughly equal, both at about 50%. <br />{" "}
                    <br /> After 1971, the trend continued, and the percentage
                    of owned accommodation kept rising. It peaked at around 68%
                    in 1991 and 2001. Meanwhile, the proportion of rented
                    households dropped to around 32% during the same period. By
                    2011, although the percentage of owned households decreased
                    slightly to about 64%, it was still much higher than that of
                    rented households, which was around 36%. <br /> <br />{" "}
                    Overall, there was a significant shift from renting to
                    owning accommodation in England and Wales during the 93-year
                    period.
