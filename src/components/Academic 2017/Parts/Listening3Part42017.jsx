        "OK, so we've been looking at how manmade changes in our environment can affect wildlife. Now, I'll discuss a particular example. Let's take a look at mercury. Mercury is one of the 120 or so elements that make up all matter, and it has the symbol Hg. It's a shiny silvery substance, you may have seen it in old-fashioned thermometers. But it's not used much for domestic purposes now, because it's highly toxic. But the problem is that the amount of mercury in the environment is increasing. The main reason for this is the power plants used to produce electricity. The main source of energy that most of them use is still coal, and when it's burned, it releases mercury into the atmosphere. Some of this gets deposited into lakes and rivers, and if it's ingested by a fish, it's not excreted, it stays in the fish's body. And it enters the food chain. ",

          text: "So, it's been known for some time that birds which eat fish may be affected, but what wasn't known until quite recently is that those that eat insects can also be affected.",

        "So, a woman called Claire Varian-Ramos is doing some research on how this is affecting birds. And rather than looking at how many birds are actually killed by mercury poisoning, she's looking for more subtle sub-effects. And these may be to do with the behavior of the birds, or with the effect of mercury on the way their brain works, so whether it leads to problems with memory for example.",
