                  The bar chart and table present data on a country's export
                  earnings in different categories in 2015 and 2016, along with
                  the percentage change from 2015 to 2016. <br /> <br /> In
                  terms of export earnings, petroleum products and engineered
                  goods were the top-two categories in both years. Petroleum
                  products earned around 60 billion dollars in 2015 and slightly
                  more in 2016, while engineered goods increased from
                  approximately 57 billion in 2015 to over 60 billion in 2016.
                  Gems and jewellery, agricultural products, and textiles had
                  lower earnings, with gems and jewellery seeing a decline in
                  value from approximately 42 billion in 2015 to around 40
                  billion in 2016. Textiles, on the other hand, observed a
                  significant increase from approximately 26 billion in 2015 to
                  over 30 billion, while agricultural products remained
                  relatively stable at around 30 billion. <br /> <br /> The
                  table reveals that most categories experienced growth in 2016
                  except for gems and jewellery. Textiles had the highest
                  percentage increase at 15.24%, followed by engineered goods at
                  8.5%. Petroleum products and agricultural products also grew
                  by 3% and 0.81% respectively. However, gems and jewellery
                  witnessed a 5.18% decrease in value. <br /> <br /> Overall,
                  the export performance showed a mixed trend across different
                  product categories.
