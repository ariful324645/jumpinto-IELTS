              Southwest Airport: Current Layout and Redevelopment Plan
            </h1>
            <p className="mt-5">
              The provided plans illustrate the current layout of Southwest
              Airport and its projected appearance after redevelopment in the
              coming year. <br /> <br /> Currently, the airport has a relatively
              simple structure. There are eight gates numbered 1 - 8, with a
              walkway on the left side leading to them. The departure hall is
              located on the left side of the arrival hall. Within the departure
              hall, there is a combined security and passport control area,
              along with a check-in counter and a café. The right-hand side
              serves as the arrival hall, which appears relatively empty in the
              plan except for the passport control area and customs area. <br />{" "}
              <br /> After development, significant changes are evident. The
              number of gates will increase to eighteen, arranged in a more
              complex Y-shaped layout. A sky train is added in the middle to
              transport passengers. A bag drop area is incorporated into the
              departure hall, occupying the former check-in counter area.
              Meanwhile, the check-in counter is relocated to the previous café
              area, while the café is moved to the lower-left corner of the
              departure hall. In the arrival hall, new facilities such as a
              café, an ATM, and a car hire service are introduced. Additionally,
              a shops area is included between the security check area and the
              gates near the departures side. <br /> <br />
              Overall, the redeveloped airport aims to enhance capacity and
              passenger convenience.
