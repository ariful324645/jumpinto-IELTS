              Police Budget in One Area of Britain (2017 - 2018)
            </h1>
            <p className="mt-5">
              The provided materials display the police budget in a British area
              for 2017 and 2018, covering funding sources and expenditure
              distribution. <br /> <br /> Overall, the total police budget
              increased from £304.7 million in 2017 to £318.6 million in 2018.
              National government funding rose slightly from £175.5 million to
              £177.8 million, local taxes contributed £91.2 million in 2017 and
              £102.3 million in 2018, showing a notable growth, while other
              sources had a marginal increase from £38 million to £38.5 million.{" "}
              <br /> <br /> Regarding spending, in 2017, 75% of the budget went
              to salaries for officers and staff, 8% to technology, and 17% to
              buildings and transport. In 2018, the proportion for salaries
              decreased to 69%, technology spending increased to 14%, and the
              percentage for buildings and transport remained the same at 17%.
              Thus, there was a shift from salary-related expenses to technology
              investment between the two years.
