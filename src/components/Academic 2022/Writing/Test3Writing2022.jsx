              Family Weekly Income Spending in 1968 and 2018
            </h1>
            <p className="mt-5">
              The bar chart compares the average weekly spending patterns of
              families in a country in 1968 and 2018, presented as a percentage
              of weekly income. In 1968, food was the largest expense,
              accounting for close to 35% of the weekly income <br /> <br />
              .However, by 2018, this proportion dropped significantly to around
              17%. Housing expenditure showed an opposite trend. In 1968, it
              made up a small part, roughly 10%, but in 2018, it increased to
              about 19%. <br /> <br />
              Spending on fuel and power, clothing and footwear, and personal
              goods decreased from 1968 to 2018. For instance, fuel and power
              spending fell from about 7% to around 4%. On the other hand,
              expenditure on transport and leisure increased. The most notable
              growth was in leisure, which rose from approximately 9% in 1968 to
              around 22% in 2018. <br /> <br /> The only category that remained
              relatively unchanged was household goods spending, which accounted
              for around 8% of weekly income in both 1968 and 2018. <br />{" "}
              <br /> Overall, the chart reveals significant changes in family
              spending priorities over the 50-year period.
