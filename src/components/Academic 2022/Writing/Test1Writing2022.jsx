              Norbiton Industrial Area: Current and Planned Development
            </h1>
            <p className="mt-5">
              The two maps depict the current state and the planned future
              development of an industrial area in Norbiton. <br /> <br />{" "}
              Currently, the area is mainly occupied by factories. There's a
              circular road junction in the middle, with factories located
              around it and to the east. The area is bordered by a river to the
              north and farmland beyond it, and the town lies to the west.{" "}
              <br /> <br />
              In the planned future development, significant changes are
              evident. Most of the factories will be replaced by housing. New
              facilities such as a playground, a school, shops, and a medical
              centre will be constructed. The shops will be built on the western
              side near the town. The medical centre will be placed south of the
              circular junction. A new road will cross the river, connecting the
              northern housing area to the rest of the development. <br />{" "}
              <br /> Overall, the area is transforming from an
              industrial-focused zone to a more residential and
              community-oriented one.
