                  Changes in Grange Park from 1920 to Present
                </h1>
                <p className="mt-5">
                  The two plans illustrate Grange Park in 1920 and its current
                  state. Overall, the park has undergone significant changes
                  over the years. <br /> <br /> In 1920, the park had two
                  entrances, one on Arnold Avenue and the other on Eldon Street.
                  There were three rose gardens evenly distributed in several
                  corners of the park, a stage for musicians located slightly
                  left of center, a fountain in the center, a pond for water
                  plants on the upper right, and a glasshouse near the Eldon
                  Street entrance. Seats were placed around these features.{" "}
                  <br /> <br /> Today, the layout is quite different. The stage
                  for musicians has been replaced by an amphitheatre for
                  concerts on the left side. The central fountain is gone, and
                  in its place, there is a large rose garden surrounded by
                  seats. The pond and glasshouse have been replaced by a café
                  and a children's play area respectively. A new water feature
                  has been added near the Eldon Street entrance, along with an
                  underground car park accessible from the lower right corner of
                  the park. <br /> <br /> These changes reflect the park's
                  adaptation to modern needs for recreation and convenience.
