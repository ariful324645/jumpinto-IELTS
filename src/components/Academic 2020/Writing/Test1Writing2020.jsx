                  Cities

                <p className="mt-5">
                  The given bar chart illustrates the buying and consumption
                  patterns of coffee and tea among inhabitants of five
                  Australian cities - Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, and
                  Hobart - spanning a four-week period. <br /> <br /> Overall,
                  with the exception of Adelaide, visiting a café for coffee or
                  tea was a popular activity in all cities. Melbourne had the
                  highest percentage of café-goers at around 63%, closely
                  followed by Hobart at approximately 62%. Sydney also had a
                  relatively high proportion at roughly 61%. Brisbane and
                  Adelaide were less enthusiastic about café visits, with around
                  56% and 49% respectively. <br /> <br /> When it came to buying
                  instant coffee, Hobart had the highest percentage (nearly
                  55%), followed by Brisbane (around 53%). Sydney and Melbourne
                  had similar figures ranging between 45% and 50%. In Adelaide,
                  the proportion of people choosing instant coffee hovered
                  around 50%, making it the most popular choice among Adelaide
                  residents. <br /> <br /> In terms of purchasing fresh coffee,
                  Sydney led with around 44%, followed by Melbourne in the
                  vicinity of 42%. Brisbane, Adelaide, and Hobart had lower
                  percentages, with Brisbane and Adelaide both hovering around
                  34%, and Hobart at roughly 38%. <br /> <br /> Generally, the
                  data indicates differences in coffee and tea-related habits
                  among the five cities, with café visits being a common
                  preference across most of them.
