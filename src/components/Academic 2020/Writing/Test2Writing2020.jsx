                  Tourist Numbers on a Caribbean Island (2010 - 2017)
                </h1>
                <p className="mt-5">
                  The line graph illustrates the number of tourists visiting a
                  Caribbean island from 2010 to 2017, categorized into those
                  staying on cruise ships, those staying on the island, and the
                  total number of visitors. <br /> <br /> Overall, the total
                  number of tourists showed a steady upward trend throughout the
                  period. In 2010, it started at about 1 million and increased
                  significantly to around 3.5 million by 2017. <br /> <br /> The
                  number of visitors staying on the island had a more stable
                  pattern. It began at around 0.75 million in 2010, slowly
                  increased from 2011 to 1.5 million in 2013, and remained at
                  approximately 1.5 million from 2013 to 2015. It slightly
                  dropped to around 1.2 million in 2016 before rebounded to 1.5
                  million in 2017. <br /> <br /> The number of tourists staying
                  on cruise ships had a more erratic growth. Starting at a low
                  of about 0.25 million in 2010, it first rose to around 0.5
                  million in 2011, dropped back to the 2010 level in 2012, then
                  grew steadily, reaching about 2 million in 2017. <br /> <br />{" "}
                  Comparatively, the growth rate of cruise-ship visitors was
                  much more variable compared to those staying on the island,
                  but both contributed to the overall increase in the total
                  number of tourists to the island.
