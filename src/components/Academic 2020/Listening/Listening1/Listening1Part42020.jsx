        "So it's alarming that all across the country, numbers of eucalyptus are falling. Because the trees are dying off prematurely.",
        "So what are the reasons for this? One possible reason is disease.",
        "As far back as the 1970s the trees started getting a disease called Mundulla Yellows.",
        "The trees' leaves would gradually turn yellow then the tree would die.",
        "It wasn't until 2004 that they found the cause of the problem was lime, or calcium hydroxide to give it its proper chemical name.",

          text: "Which was being used in the construction of roads.",

        "When this was injected back into the affected trees, they immediately recovered.",
        "But this problem only affected a relatively small number of trees.",
        "By 2000, huge numbers of eucalyptus were dying along Australia's East Coast of a disease known as Bell-miner Associated Die-back.",
        "The bell-miner is a bird, and the disease seems to be common where there are high populations of bell-miners.",

        "So these birds and insects flourish at the expense of other species, and eventually so much damage is done to the leaves that the tree dies.",
        "But experts say that trees can start looking sick before any sign of bell-miner associated dieback.",
        "So, it looks as if the problem might have another explanation.",
        "One possibility is that it's to do with the huge bushfires that we have in Australia.",

        {

          number: 36,

          text: "By affecting the composition of the soil and removing nutrients from it.",
          number: 37,
        },
        "So some bushfires are actually essential for the eucalyptus to survive, as long as they are not too frequent.",
        "In fact, there's evidence that Australia's indigenous people practiced regular burning of bushland for thousands of years before the arrival of the Europeans.",
        "But since Europeans arrived on the continent, the number of bushfires has been strictly controlled.",
        {
          text: "Now scientists believe that this reduced frequency of bushfires to low levels has led to what's known as dry rainforest, which seems an odd name, as usually we associate tropical rainforest with wet conditions.",
