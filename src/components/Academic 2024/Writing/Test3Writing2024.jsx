              Biofuel Production: How Ethanol Is Made
            </h1>
            <p className="mt-5">
              The diagram illustrates the production process of ethanol, a type
              of biofuel, in a cyclical manner. This cycle for biofuel
              production involves three main stages: harvesting and preparing
              plant material for processing, producing ethanol by chemical
              processing, then using the fuel for transportation, before the
              cycle begins again. <br /> <br /> The process commences with
              plants and trees growing, utilizing energy from sunlight and
              carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Once mature, they are harvested.
              Subsequently, the harvested materials undergo pre-processing to
              obtain cellulose. <br /> <br />
              The cellulose then enters the processing stage. Here, it is
              converted into sugars, and with the addition of microbes, ethanol
              is produced. <br /> <br /> After production, ethanol serves as a
              fuel for various vehicles such as cars, trucks, and airplanes.
              During the combustion of ethanol in these vehicles, carbon dioxide
              is emitted back into the atmosphere. This carbon dioxide is then
              available for plants and trees to use in their growth process
              again, completing the cycle. <br /> <br /> Overall, the production
              of ethanol is a sustainable process that recycles carbon dioxide
              and makes use of natural resources like plants and trees to create
              a renewable energy source.
